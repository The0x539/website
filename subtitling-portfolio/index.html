      <h1>Stuff I’ve Subtitled</h1>
      <p>
        A sampling of content I’ve worked on subtitles for (<em>mostly</em> anime) and put out into the world.

        My work is entirely unsanctioned; I do it because I believe I can provide a superior viewing experience versus other options,
        <em>especially</em> official offerings, which sadly often fail to meet bare-minimum standards of quality. The things I’ve seen…

        Given the nature of this work, providing links here doesn’t seem like a particularly great idea.

            Trapped on a mysterious train that seems to never end, a headstrong 12-year-old girl must use her wits
            to uncover the train’s many secrets – and hopefully return home.

          <p>
            This is the story of an unlikely pair: one a member of a ruined race, the other a watchman of the forest.
            It tells of their travels together and of the bond between father and daughter.

          <p>
            As a group of university students go out for a night on the town,
            a raven-haired sophomore experiences a series of surreal encounters with the local nightlife.

            Meanwhile, an older schoolmate of hers concocts increasingly contrived and elaborate “chance encounters”
            in the hope of getting her attention, but fate conspires to foil every attempt he makes.

          <h2>One-Punch Man</h2>

            alt="Saitama in his superhero getup delivering a walloping punch to a colossal foe." />
          <p>
            After years of training, Saitama has grown so strong that he can defeat any enemy with ease.
            This godly strength, however, presents an unexpected problem:
            unable to find a worthy opponent, Saitama has grown bored with fighting evildoers
            and struggles to find meaning in the heroism he’d dreamed of as a child.

          <h2>Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid</h2>

            alt="The Kobayashi household enjoying a midday nap on the couch." />
          <p>
            An ordinary hardworking software engineer, Kobayashi sets off for work one day only to find a dragon at her doorstep.
            The two had apparently met the prior night when Kobayashi, thoroughly drunk,
            wandered into the mountains, and after learning that Tohru, the dragon, has no place to call home,
            extended an offer to work as a maid in her apartment.
            Their life together is by no means an uneventful one, but it’s more ordinary than one might expect.
