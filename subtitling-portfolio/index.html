      <h1>Stuff I’ve Subtitled</h1>
      <p>
        A sampling of content I’ve worked on subtitles for (<em>mostly</em>
        anime) and put out into the world. My work is entirely unsanctioned; I
        do it because I believe I can provide a superior viewing experience
        versus other options, <em>especially</em> official offerings, which will
        often fail to meet bare-minimum standards of quality. The things I’ve
        seen…

              Trapped on a mysterious train that seems to never end, a
              headstrong 12-year-old girl must use her wits to uncover the
              train’s many secrets – and hopefully return home.

            <figcaption>
              This is the story of an unlikely pair: one a member of a ruined
              race, the other a watchman of the forest. It tells of their
              travels together and of the bond between father and daughter.

              As a group of university students go out for a night on the town,
              a raven-haired sophomore experiences a series of surreal
              encounters with the local nightlife.

              Meanwhile, an older schoolmate of hers concocts increasingly
              contrived and elaborate “chance encounters” in the hope of getting
              her attention, but fate conspires to foil every attempt he makes.

            <figcaption>
              After years of training, Saitama has grown so strong that he can
              defeat any enemy with ease. This godly strength, however, presents
              an unexpected problem: unable to find a worthy opponent, Saitama
              has grown bored and struggles to find meaning in the heroism he’d
              dreamed of as a child.

              alt="The Kobayashi household enjoying a midday nap on the couch." />
            <figcaption>
              An ordinary hardworking software engineer, Kobayashi sets off for
              work one day only to find a dragon at her doorstep. The two had
              apparently met the prior night when Kobayashi, thoroughly drunk,
              wandered into the mountains, and after learning that Tohru, the
              dragon, has no place to call home, extended an offer to work as a
              maid in her apartment. Their life together is by no means an
              uneventful one, but it’s more ordinary than one might expect.
